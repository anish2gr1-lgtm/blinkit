# blinkit dashboard

# 1. Purpose
The purpose of this project was to study Blinkit’s sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution, and convert raw transactional data into clear and useful business insights using Power BI. 
The main goal was to help decision-makers easily understand how the business was performing across products and outlets. This project was needed because Blinkit did not have a single, consolidated view of its 
sales data, customer feedback, and outlet performance. Most data was scattered across files, and reporting was largely manual. Because of this, making data-driven decisions was slow and inefficient for stakeholders.

# 2. Tech Stack
The technologies used to build the dashboard
Example:
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies
PowerBI Deshtop - Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
Power Query - Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
DAX(Data Analysis Expressions) - Used for calculating metrics like total sales, average sales, number of items sold and customer rating.

Business impact & Insights

# Example:
Business Problem - This project was needed because Blinkit did not have a single, consolidated view of its sales data, customer feedback, and outlet performance. Most data was scattered across files, and reporting 
was largely manual. Because of this, making data-driven decisions was slow and inefficient for stakeholders.

Goal of the Dashboard - To help the decision makers easily understand how the business was performing across products and outlets.

Walk through of key visuals 
Key KPIs: Total Sales: $1.20M in, Average Sales: $140.99, Number of Items Sold: 8523, Avg Customer Rating: 3.9 in 2 categories Low Fat and Regular Fat.
Outlet Location Filter Panel: An interactive slicer let users filter all visuals by selecting Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 locations 
Outlet Size by Donut Chart: Display the distribution of outlet size by high, medium and low sizes. 
Outlet Location by Funnel: Display the distribution of outlet location as Tier 1, Tier2 and Tier 3. 

Business Impact and Insights:
The dashboard also showed a strong relationship between customer ratings and sales performance, where higher-rated products and outlets consistently generated more revenue. With this setup, stakeholders could 
quickly identify top-performing and low-performing products and outlets, reduce manual reporting efforts, and take faster, data-driven decisions related to inventory planning, promotions, and outlet optimization. 
Insights:
1.Sales were highly concentrated in a limited number of product categories and outlet types.
2.Some products had high availability but low sales and poor ratings, which pointed to overstocking and low customer preference.
3.Customer ratings showed a strong relationship with sales performance.
